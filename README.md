# Email Spam Detection Prototype Plugin

## Description
This project involves developing an AI-based plugin that can differentiate between spam and genuine emails in an inbox. Additionally, it has the capability to send personalized responses to authentic emails. The model uses logistic regression for detecting spam emails and integrates basic libraries to send emails through a Python script. Text data is converted into feature vectors for input into the logistic regression model.

## Features
- **Spam Detection**: Uses logistic regression to classify emails as spam or genuine.
- **Personalized Responses**: Automatically sends personalized responses to genuine emails.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with online services to monitor and manage email inboxes.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn (for logistic regression)
  - NLTK or any other text processing library
  - smtplib (for sending emails)
  - Other necessary Machine Learning libraries
